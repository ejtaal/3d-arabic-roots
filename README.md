# Background

## What is it?

Arabic roots are placed within the space of a 3D cube according to the place of their constituent letters in the alphabet. You can click and turn the cube in any direction, zoom using the scroll wheel, as well as select/deselect subsets of the data to view only roots of certain categories. When you hover over a single root it will display the details of the root and the forms listed in the lexicon.

## What lexicon?

The data based on the text that has been taken from the Perseus project which has compiled the entire text of Lane's Lexicon online in xml and other formats:
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus%3Acorpus%3Aperseus%2Cwork%2CLane%2C%20An%20Arabic-English%20Lexicon

## Legend

The following page from Lane's Lexicon is required to decipher to "forms" of each root as listed when you hover over a certain root.

![Lane's Lexicon page about verb confugation forms](./LL-forms-ll-0029.png)

Given the fact that most Arabic roots consist of 3 letters, it seemed interesting to plot them in a 3D space to see if there are any interesting patterns. The data was generated by parsing the xml of Lane's Lexicon as published by the Perseus Tufts project.

# Observations

## Open square in the middle as seen from all sides

From all sides of the cube it appears there's a square in the middle. This seems to be due to the fact that very few roots have more than 2 of the following letters:
"س","ش","ص","ض","ط","ظ"

![A center square void is visible from every side of the cube](./Center-square-open.png)

Of course a rare but notable exception that proves the rule is shown, namely عطش (to sneeze), and one could argue at least this one only appears here due to onomatopoeia.

## The letter ر seems to be the most popular for second and third letter of roots

![The layers of letter Ra for the second and third letter shown](./Ra-popular-2nd-3rd-letter.png)

The image appears to show that the letter ر seems to be rather popular compared to all other letters. Whether this is an optical illusion or backed by hard data is shown below...
